# Project Overview

This repository contains resources, scripts, and educational materials related to machine learning, data science, and programming. Below is the directory structure and its contents.

## Directory Structure


## Directory Details

### 1. `books`
A collection of PDFs covering a variety of machine learning topics:
- Introductory and advanced resources on machine learning.
- Books on Python, R, and statistical foundations.
- Mathematical prerequisites like probability and linear algebra.

### 2. `cat-soop`
Contains resources for the `cat-soop` framework:
- `source`: Source code or configuration files.
- `source.zip`: A compressed version of the source directory.

### 3. `curso`
Course materials organized by weeks:
- `01_week`: First week's content.
- `02_week`: Second week's content.

### 4. `notas`
Space for personal notes related to the course or projects.

### 5. `prerequisitos`
Scripts and resources to handle prerequisites:
- `open_url_at_once.sh`: Script to open multiple URLs.
- `urls.txt`: A list of prerequisite URLs.

### 6. `tutorial_numpy`
Contains Python tutorials:
- `01_array_creation.py`: An introductory script for creating arrays with NumPy.

### 7. `urls curso`, `urls learning`, `urls ML examples`
Directories for categorized URL collections:
- Each contains:
  - `open_url_at_once.sh`: A script to open URLs in bulk.
  - `urls.txt`: A list of URLs for reference.

## Usage

1. **Explore Books**:
   - Navigate to the `books` directory for in-depth reading materials.

2. **Run Scripts**:
   - Use `open_url_at_once.sh` scripts to open all URLs listed in `urls.txt`.

3. **Learn with Tutorials**:
   - Start with `tutorial_numpy/01_array_creation.py` to learn about array creation in NumPy.

4. **Follow Courses**:
   - Access weekly content in the `curso` directory.

5. **Customize and Extend**:
   - Add your notes in the `notas` directory.
   - Update `urls.txt` files with additional links.
